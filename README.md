# India-Election-analysis-2024-SQL
This project presents a comprehensive SQL-based analysis of the India General Elections 2024. It focuses on seat distribution, vote analysis, party alliances, and constituency-level insights using structured SQL queries.

# Tools & Technologies Used
•	SQL (Structured Query Language)
•	MySQL / SQL Server (compatible with both)
•	Relational Database Concepts

# Dataset:
•	constituencywise_results
•	partywise_results
•	statewise_results
•	states
•	constituencywise_details
Each table contains election-related details such as winning candidates, vote counts, party affiliations, and state-wise breakdowns.

# Key Features & Insights
•	Total Seats Analysis: Query to count total seats and distribution across states.
•	Alliance Performance: Seats won by NDA, I.N.D.I.A., and OTHER parties.
•	Winning vs Runner-Up: CTE used to determine top candidates in each constituency.
•	Vote Breakdown: Detailed comparison of EVM and postal votes by constituency.
•	State-wise Summary: Votes, candidates, and seat distribution per state.
•	Party Classification: Added a new column for party_alliance and updated it.

 # Problem Statement:- 
1)	Which party alliance won the most seats?
2)	Top 10 candidates with highest EVM votes.
3)	Seats won by each party in a specific state (e.g., Andhra Pradesh).
4)	Detailed results for a specific constituency (e.g., Amethi in Uttar Pradesh).

 # Advanced SQL Techniques Used
•	CTE (Common Table Expressions)
•	ROW_NUMBER() OVER PARTITION
•	CASE WHEN conditional aggregations
•	JOIN operations across multiple tables
•	GROUP BY and ORDER BY for summarized outputs

# conclusion:-
This project provides a structured analysis of the India General Elections 2024 using SQL. It highlights key insights such as seat distribution, party performance, and voting trends across states. Advanced SQL techniques were used to extract meaningful information from complex datasets. This analysis can help understand electoral patterns and support data-driven decision-making in political research.
